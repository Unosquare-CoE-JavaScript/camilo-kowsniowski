# Principal Components Patterns

## 1. Compound Component Pattern

Compound component pattern by far the favorite React component pattern. You might be familiar with `<select>…</select>` element with `<option>…</option>` elements as children in the HTML world. This component pattern follows the same principle:

    <label for="dunder-mifflin">Salesman of the year</label>
    <select name=”salesman” id=”dunder-mifflin”>
     <option value=”dwight”>Dwight Schrute</option>
     <option value=”jim”>Jim Halpert</option>
     <option value=”andy”>Andy Bernard</option>
    </select>

I commonly use this pattern to separate my header content, body content and footer content in my every React Native project (I like to call this component `Layout`). We know that every mobile apps has a header component for navigation and showing title, and the main content that can be scrolled in the middle and has a footer that may contain buttons at the bottom (footer may not be common though)

## 2. Render Props Component Pattern

Render props component pattern is another great way to leverage the code reusability. I use render props pattern to do tasks like toggling a modal or share button, or to manage the state of Activity Indicator, to name a few in React Native.

It simply means passing props named “render”(hence the name) that is a function to a component and invoking that function in the component so that the resources can be passed back. It can be a little confusing for the first time so let's see an example using a simple Toggle RPC.

# 3. Higher-Order Component Pattern

The higher-order component pattern and render props component pattern are similar in their functionalities but their implementation is quite different. I use this pattern typically when a screen has to fetch some data from the API for the first time, when a component mounts and that screen is inaccessible to the user until data has been fetched successfully. But if the request fails then there’s nothing to show to the user since it failed so we have to navigate the user back to the previous screen automatically. Here’s how it works.

Here’s a simple `withRandomPhotoList` HOC implementation that queries photo list from `[jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)`:

# Note:

## What’s the actual difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?

Sprinkled all over the official [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) are pointers to the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`.

Perhaps the most prominent of these is found in the first detailing the `useLayoutEffect` Hook:

The first clause in the sentence above is easy to understand. The signature for both Hooks are identical. The signature for `useEffect` is shown below:

- useEffect(() => { // do something }, [array, dependency])
- The signature for `useLayoutEffect` is exactly the same!
- useLayoutEffect(() => { // do something }, [array, dependency])2

In fact, if you go through a codebase and replace every `useEffect` call with `useLayoutEffect`, although different, this will work in most cases.

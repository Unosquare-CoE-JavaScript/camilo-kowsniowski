## Encapsulation and Least Exposure (POLE)

Encapsulation is often cited as a principle of object-oriented (OO) programming, but it’s more fundamental and broadly applicable than that. The goal of encapsulation is the bundling or co-location of information (data) and behavior (functions) that together serve a common purpose.

## What Is a Module?

A module is a collection of related data and functions (often referred to as methods in this context), characterized by a division between hidden private details and public accessible details, usually called the “public API.”

### NOTE:

    A module is also stateful: it maintains some information over time, along with functionality to access and update that information.

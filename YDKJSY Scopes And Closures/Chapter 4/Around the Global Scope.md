# Global Scope definition

A variable is said to be in global scope when it is declared outside of a function or block. We will be able to access these types of variables from any part of our code, either inside or outside a function. The window object is an example of a global scope.

## ES Modules (ESM)

ES6 introduced first-class support for the module pattern (covered in Chapter 8). One of the most obvious impacts of using ESM is how it changes the behavior of the observably top-level scope in a file.

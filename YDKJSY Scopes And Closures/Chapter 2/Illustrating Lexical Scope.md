# Illustrating Lexical Scope

Imagine you come across a pile of marbles, and notice that all the marbles are colored red, blue, or green. Letâ€™s sort all the marbles, dropping the red ones into a red bucket, green into a green bucket, and blue into a blue bucket. After sorting, when you later need a green marble, you already know the green bucket is where to go to get it. (Example 1)

## Nested Scope

One of the key aspects of lexical scope is that any time an identifier reference cannot be found in the current scope, the next outer scope in the nesting is consulted; that process is repeated until an answer is found or there are no more scopes to consult.

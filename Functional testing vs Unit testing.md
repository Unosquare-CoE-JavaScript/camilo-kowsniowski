# What Is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a popular practice adopted by many organizations as it primarily helps to eliminate the risk of having a bug in codes.

As the name suggests, unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components are tested. The purpose is to validate each unit of the software code and check whether they are performing as expected.

The goal of unit testing is to break each part of the source code into the unit and check that each part works properly. It means that if any set of input is not functional, it should return an expected output.

## The Prime Objective Of Unit Testing Is:

- To isolate a section of code.
- To verify the correctness of code.
- To test every function and procedure.
- To find early bugs and fix in the development cycle and to save  
  costs.
- To help the developers to understand the code base and enable them to
  make changes quickly.
- To help for code reuse.

## Advantages Of Unit Testing:

Unit Testing allows developers to learn about the functionality that a unit provides. It also tells you how to use it to gain a basic understanding of the unit API.

Unit testing allows the developer to refine code and make sure the module works properly.

Unit testing enables testing parts of the project without the dependency of others for completion.

# What Is Functional Testing?

Functional testing is a software testing process that validates the software system against functional requirements. The purpose of Functional testing is to test each functionality of the software application, by providing apt input, output verification against the Functional requirements. In other words, functional testing is a type of testing whereby the system is tested against the function requirement/specification.

## The Prime Objective Of Functional Testing Is:

- Finding defects that the programmer may have missed while developing
  software.
- To Gain confidence and provide information about the level of
  quality.
- To prevent defects.
- To ensure that the result meets the business and the user’s
  requirements

## Advantages Of Functional Testing:

- Functional testing is necessary for evaluating the performance and  
  the functionality of a software application before we deliver it to  
  the client.

- It takes the user’s perspective into consideration, which allows the
  software development team to create test scenarios that represent the
  real-world use scenarios.
- It allows the team to meet the requirements of the user as well as  
  the client.

- It helps improve actual system usage.

- It enhances the quality of the software product.

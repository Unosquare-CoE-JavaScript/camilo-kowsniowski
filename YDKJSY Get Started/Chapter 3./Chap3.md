# Principal concepts

## Iteration

The iterator pattern defines a data structure called an “iter- ator” that has a reference to an underlying data source (like the query result rows), which exposes a method like next(). Calling next() returns the next piece of data (i.e., a “record” or “row” from a database query).

## Operators

### _Spread_

To spread an iterator, you have to have something to spread it into. There are two possibilities in JS: an array or an argument list for a function call.

## Clousure

Closure is when a function remembers and contin- ues to access variables from outside its scope, even when the function is executed in a different scope.

## this Keyword

this is not a fixed characteristic of a function based on the function’s definition, but rather a dynamic characteristic that’s determined each time the function is called.

## Prototypes

Think about a prototype as a linkage between two objects; the linkage is hidden behind the scenes, though there are ways to expose and observe it. This prototype linkage occurs when an object is created; it’s linked to another object that already exists.
